Fork the project.\r\n2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.\r\n3. Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.\r\n4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull).\r\n5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.\r\n"}
